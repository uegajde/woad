### declaration besides the MIT license: 
* it is welcome to seek and take something useful here
* it is a collection accumulated during my research work, instead of a well-planned standalone project
* in another word, it is written for a narrow purpose (my work), but not wide applications  
* although the code and formula are checked, the correctness or any quality is NOT guaranteed when it is used for other purposes
* and, some functions might only work for a specific problem
* this module is greatly based on open-source projects including, numpy, wrf-python, cartopy, and so on. I much appreciate their great work and unselfish conviction.
